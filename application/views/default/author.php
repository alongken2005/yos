	<h2>YouShelf Author Program</h2>
	<div>
We cordially invite everyone with a talent and passion to create engaging stories to use YouShelf to publish your creation to the world, one chapter a time!<br>

<br>You can upload your story through author dashboard.  For every author, you publish you own creation chapter by chapter.  You set which of the chapters are free, and which of them are premium content that readers will need to pay.  You set the price for every thousand words for the premium content.  As a pilot program, effective until the end of 2016, every author on YouShelf platform will keep 100% of the net reader revenue (i.e., user paid price netting necessary tax withholding and channel charges we pay others).<br><br>

You will have reader stats and revenue stats available to you on the author dashboard.  Every month, we calculate readers' net revenue for your stories, and either wire fund or mail you the check that is above $30.  Amount lower than $30 will be accumulated and sent to you when it reaches the threshold.<br><br>

For every book you make available on YouShelf, you will have a unique link from the book info page that you can send to your family and friends, fans, and promote to people you think will like your creation.  Click on Facebook, Twitter signs on the book info page to share the story directly, or copy the URL link to share on other social networking sites you prefer. <br><br>

At YouShelf, we like to keep it simple.  Here are a few <a href="<?=site_url('author-termsandconditions')?>">terms</a> we should agree to and stick to them when you are in our Author Program.  Other than that, create and share away!  We are eager to read the story you have for us all!<br><br>

To become an author, just click on <a href="<?=site_url('user/reg')?>">Sign Up</a> to become a registered user first; then please follow the 'Become an author' link on your user dashboard to become an author.  Please feel free to ask any questions by emailing us at <a href="mailto:author-support@youshelf.com">author-support@youshelf.com</a>, we will get back to you within 24 hours.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>
